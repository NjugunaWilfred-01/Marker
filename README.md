# Marker
Logistics app with google maps implementation with current location.


## Deployment
To run the project, first clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/NjugunaWilfred-01/Marker.git` and run the following commands:
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
The connection point will be given on the terminal and you can open it on the local browser.

There will be a map that show your current location pinned in the map. 


The API used here OpenStreet Maps API which is the best option I could find. Some of the other APIs I tried were Google Maps API, MapBox API and HERE Maps API. However, they all had limitations that made them unsuitable for this project. Google Maps API required a subscription fee, MapBox API required a subscription fee and HERE Maps API required a subscription fee. Therefore, I settled for OpenStreet Maps API which is free to use.
